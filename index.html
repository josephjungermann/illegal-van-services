                    <p>Thousands of daily commuters wait on the crowded intersection of Sutphin Boulevard and Archer Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, for the next bus to take them home after a long day of work.</p>
                    <p>While people jam into the crowded Q6 line at 5 p.m. on a Monday, other frustrated patrons are left behind searching for taxis or other transportation options.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, they settle for choices that aren’t legal.</p>
                    <p>“You have other communities that have quality bus service, and what do you have in our community? We have vans. We still have the legal and illegal vans,” said Queens Community Board 12 District Manager and mass-transit commuter Yvonne Reddick.</p>
                    <p>The vans that Ms. Reddick references appear daily on Jamaica Center and Archer Avenue/Parsons Boulevard, a section that accounts for the highest bus ridership volume and intensity in all five boroughs, <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_bus_annual.htm">according to the MTA</a>.</p>
                    <p>Though most vans and drivers are licensed by the Department of Transportation and the Taxi & Limousine Commission, some aren’t, and it’s hard for commuters to tell the difference.</p>
                    <p>David Williams, 27, a Queens resident who works at New York State’s Veterans’ Home in St. Albans, deals with an average commute time that is 49 minutes one-way—the second-longest throughout all the five boroughs, according to <a href="https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/queens/12">NYC.gov’s census data</a>.</p>
                    <p>“Rides are only two dollars. It is worth it because you don’t have to wait too long for a bus,” said Williams after being turned down from a van parked on Archer Avenue/Parsons Boulevard because its six-passenger limit had been exceeded.</p>
                    <p>“When they’re boarding those vans, they don’t know whether the driver is insured or if they have proper licenses,” Reddick says. “At the end of the day, people just want to get home. I don’t even think they are thinking about safety.”</p>
                    <p>Williams also acknowledged the potential risks that come with misidentifying unlicensed vans from legitimate ones but admitted that safety often takes a back seat to convenience.</p>
                    <p>“To be honest, [the drivers] won’t tell you whether they are legal, but people just jump in the vans anyway.”</p>
                    <p>The MTA’s proposed <a href="https://new.mta.info/bronxbusredesign/about">Bus Redesign Program</a> aimed to make bus transit more efficient is not expected to be released until the spring of 2020.</p>
                    <p>Executing the plan could take years, depending on the level of infrastructure repair, which may result in more commuter residents settling for illegal services over the MTA.</p>
                    <p>“We don’t have sufficient buses; we don’t have enough buses,” said Reddick. “There’s no reason somebody during peak hours has to wait an hour or 45 minutes and all for a bus.”</p>
                    <p>To make matters worse, Queens MTA buses have crawled to a record slow 8.9 mph average speed in August 2019, per the <a href="http://busdashboard.mta.info/">MTA’s Bus Performance Dashboard</a>.</p>

                    </p>Jamaica, in particular, is more vulnerable to being overrun by illegal van operations since it is one of the biggest transportation hubs throughout all five boroughs.</p>
                    <p>Queens Councilman I. Daneek Miller (D-Queens), a committee member of New York’s City Council Transportation Board, has attempted to implement strict regulations on illegal van services after proposing <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3498505&GUID=70DB1544-80FD-4AA6-8593-1C56C7E7607F&Options=&Search=">Local Law Initiative 897-A</a> at the beginning of 2019.</p>
                    <p>The legislation aims to hold the van industry accountable by issuing heavy fines up to $500 to drivers operating unlicensed vehicles.</p>
                    <p>However, whether the bill can deter drivers from picking up passengers illegally, remains in question.</p>
                    <p>“After the bill was introduced to try to curtail some of the illegal vans—the van operations—it seemed like they got worse,” said Michele Keller, a chairperson for Queens Community District 12’s Transportation Committee.</p>
                    <p>“You have to be in control of it before it gets out of hand.”</p>
